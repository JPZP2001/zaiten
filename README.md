# zaiten üéß
Welcome to Zaiten!! This is a simple Vue.js application that leverages the power of the Spotify API to help you discover music based on various filters such as genre, energy and danceability. Whether you're in the mood for something specific or just exploring, my app makes it easy to explore and find something new that you might like.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Update ‚ö†Ô∏è
With all the pain in my heart, Zaiten will not be operational until further notice. Some [recent changes](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api) to Spotify¬¥s API endpoints have blocked the functionality of my app. Hopefully one day they figure a way out to restore the APIs functionality and still cover their security and business needs.
